<h3><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h3>

<p class='dropcap'><span class="caps">This</span> volume, and those which follow it in Part VI of this series, is a
compilation from various sources. The occasion does not call for an
original treatise, but it does call for something somewhat different
from existing text-books. The books prepared for school use are too
academic and too little related to the specific needs of the apprentice
to serve the turn of those for whom this book is intended. On the other
hand the books for writers and printers are as a rule too advanced for
the best service to the beginner. The authors of this Part, therefore,
have tried to compile from a wide range of authorities such material as
would be suited to the needs and the experience of the young apprentice.</p>

<p>The "Rules for the Use and Arrangement of Words" are taken with some
modifications from "How to Write Clearly," Edwin A. Abbott, Boston;
Roberts Bros. This is a very excellent little book but is now, I
believe, out of print. The tables of irregular verbs are the same as
those used in "English Grammar for Common Schools," Robert C. and Thomas Metcalf, New York; American Book Co.</p>

<p>The student is recommended to study some good grammar with great care.
There are many good grammars. The one used in the schools in the
apprentice's locality will probably do as well as any.</p>

<p>The student should learn to use the dictionary intelligently and should
accustom himself to using it freely and frequently.</p>

<p>The student should also learn to use words correctly and freely. There
are many good books devoted to the study of words, some of which ought
to be easily available. One of the latest and one of the best is
"Putnam's Word Book" published by Putnams, New York. It costs about a dollar and a half.</p>

<h3><a name="intro" id="intro"></a>WORD STUDY AND ENGLISH GRAMMAR</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Importance of the Subject</i></p>

<p class='dropcap'><span class="caps">Word</span> study and English grammar are important to the young printer for
several reasons. In the first place, disregard of the correct use and
combination of words is a distinct mark of inferiority and a serious bar
to business and social advancement. A man's use of words is commonly
taken as a measure of his knowledge and even of his intelligence.
Carelessness in this regard often causes a man to be held in much less esteem than he really deserves.</p>

<p>In the second place, it is quite as important that the printer should
know something about the words and sentences which he puts on paper as
it is that he should know something about the paper on which he puts
them, or the type, ink, and press by means of which he puts them there.</p>

<p>In the third place, knowledge of words and their uses is indispensable
to correct proofreading which is itself a branch of the printer's craft.
A working knowledge of words and their relations, that is, of rhetoric
and grammar is therefore a tool and a very important tool of the printer.</p>

<p>This little book is not intended to be either a rhetoric or a grammar.
It is only intended to review some of the simplest principles of both
subjects, to point out a few of the commonest mistakes, and to show the
importance to the apprentice of the careful study and constant use of
some of the many books on words, their combinations, and their uses.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><a name="Word_Families" id="Word_Families"></a><i>The Word Families</i></p>

<p>All the words in the English language belong to one or another of nine
families, each of which family has a special duty. If you will always
remember to which family a word belongs and just what that family does,
you will be saved from many very common errors. These nine families
are:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> 1, nouns; 2, adjectives; 3, articles; 4, verbs; 5, pronouns; 6,
adverbs; 7, prepositions; 8, conjunctions; 9, interjections. This order
of enumeration is not exactly the same as will be found in the grammars.
It is used here because it indicates roughly the order of the appearance
of the nine families in the logical development of language. Some forms
of interjections, however, may very probably have preceded any language properly so called.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><a name="Nouns" id="Nouns"></a><i>Nouns</i></p>

<p>A noun is a word used as the name of anything that can be thought of,
<i>John</i>, <i>boy</i>, <i>paper</i>, <i>cold</i>, <i>fear</i>, <i>crowd</i>. There are three things
about a noun which indicate its relation to other words, its number, its
gender, and its case. There are two numbers, singular meaning one, and plural meaning more than one.</p>

<p>The plural is generally formed by adding <i>s</i> to the singular. There are
a small number of nouns which form their plurals differently, <i>mouse</i>,
<i>mice</i>; <i>child</i>, <i>children</i>; <i>foot</i>, <i>feet</i>. These must be learned
individually from a dictionary or spelling book. There are some nouns
which undergo changes in the final syllable when the <i>s</i> is added,
<i>torch</i>, <i>torches</i>; <i>staff</i>, <i>staves</i>; <i>fly</i>, <i>flies</i>. These also must
be learned individually. There are some nouns which have no singular,
such as <i>cattle</i>, <i>clothes</i>, some which have no plural, such as
<i>physics</i>, <i>honesty</i>, <i>news</i>, and some which are the same in both
singular and plural, such as <i>deer</i>, <i>trout</i>, <i>series</i>. Care must be
taken in the use of these nouns, as in some cases their appearance is
misleading, e. g., <i>mathematics</i>, <i>physics</i>, and the like are singular
nouns having no plural, but owing to their form they are often mistaken for plurals.</p>

<p>Compound nouns, that is to say, nouns formed by the combination of two
or three words which jointly express a single idea, generally change the
principal word in the forming of the plural, <i>hangers-on</i>, <i>ink
rollers</i>, but in a few cases both words change, for example,
<i>men-servants</i>. These forms must be learned by observation and practice.
It is very important, however, that they be thoroughly learned and
correctly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> used. Do not make such mistakes as <i>brother-in-laws</i>,
<i>man-servants</i>.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important use of number is in the relation between the
noun and the verb. The verb as well as the noun has number forms and the
number of the noun used as subject should always agree with that of the
verb with which it is connected. Such expressions as "pigs is pigs,"
"how be you?" and the like, are among the most marked evidences of
ignorance to be found in common speech. When this paragraph was
originally written a group of high school boys were playing football
under the writer's window. Scraps of their talk forced themselves upon
his attention. Almost invariably such expressions as "you was," "they
was," "he don't," "it aint," and the like took the place of the
corresponding correct forms of speech.</p>

<p>Collective nouns, that is the nouns which indicate a considerable number
of units considered as a whole, such as <i>herd</i>, <i>crowd</i>, <i>congress</i>,
present some difficulties because the idea of the individuals in the
collection interferes with the idea of the collection itself. The
collective nouns call for the singular form of the verb except where the
thought applies to the individual parts of the collection rather than to
the collection as a whole, for instance, we say,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The crowd looks large.</p></div>

<p>but we say,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The crowd look happy.</p></div>

<p>because in one case we are thinking of the crowd and in the other of the persons who compose the crowd. So in speaking of a committee, we may say</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Committee thinks that a certain thing should be done.</p></div>

<p>or that</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Committee think that a certain thing should be done.</p></div>

<p>The first phrase would indicate that the committee had considered and
acted on the subject and the statement represented a formal decision.
The second phrase would indicate the individual opinions of the members
of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> committee which might be in agreement but had not been expressed
in formal action. In doubtful cases it is safer to use the plural.</p>

<p>Entire accuracy in these cases is not altogether easy. As in the case
with all the nice points of usage it requires practice and continual
self-observation. By these means a sort of language sense is developed
which makes the use of the right word instinctive. It is somewhat
analogous to that sense which will enable an experienced bank teller to
throw out a counterfeit bill instinctively when running over a large
pile of currency even though he may be at some pains to prove its
badness when challenged to show the reason for its rejection.</p>

<p>The young student should not permit himself to be discouraged by the
apparent difficulty of the task of forming the habit of correct speech.
It is habit and rapidly becomes easier after the first efforts.</p>

<p>The relation of a noun to a verb, to another noun, or to a preposition
is called its case. There are three cases called the nominative,
objective, and possessive. When the noun does something it is in the
nominative case and is called the subject of the verb.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The man cuts.</p></div>

<p>When the noun has something done to it it is in the objective case and is called the object of the verb.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The man cuts paper.</p></div>

<p>When a noun depends on a preposition, it is also in the objective case and is called the object of the preposition.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The paper is cut by machinery.</p></div>

<p>The preposition on which a noun depends is often omitted when not needed for clearness.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The foreman gave (to) the men a holiday.<br />
He came (on) Sunday.<br />
Near (to) the press.<br />
He was ten minutes late (late by ten minutes).<br />
He is 18 years old (old by or to the extent of 18 years).</p></div>

<p>The nominative and objective cases of nouns do not differ<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> in form. They
are distinguished by their positions in the sentence and their relations to other words.</p>

<p>When one noun owns another the one owning is in the possessive case.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The man's paper is cut.</p></div>

<p>The possessive case is shown by the form of the noun. It is formed by adding <i>s</i> preceded by an apostrophe to the nominative case, thus,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>John's hat.</p></div>

<p>There is a considerable difference of usage regarding the formation of
the possessives of nouns ending in <i>s</i> in the singular. The general rule
is to proceed as in other nouns by adding the apostrophe and the other
<i>s</i> as <i>James's hat</i>. DeVinne advises following the pronunciation. Where
the second <i>s</i> is not pronounced, as often happens to avoid the
prolonged hissing sound of another <i>s</i>, he recommends omitting it in print.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Moses' hat, for Moses's hat.<br />
For conscience' sake.</p></div>

<p>Plural nouns ending in <i>s</i> add the apostrophe only; ending in other
letters they add the apostrophe and <i>s</i> like singular nouns, <i>the Jones' house</i>, <i>the children's toys</i>.</p>

<p>The possessive pronouns never take the apostrophe. We say <i>hers</i>, <i>theirs</i>, <i>its</i>. <i>It's</i> is an abbreviation for <i>it is</i>.</p>

<p>Care should be taken in forming the possessives of phrases containing
nouns in apposition, or similar compound phrases. We should say "I
called at Brown the printer's" or "since William the Conqueror's time."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><a name="Adjectives" id="Adjectives"></a><i>Adjectives</i></p>

<p>An adjective is a word used to qualify, limit, or define a noun, or a
word or phrase which has the value of a noun. Nouns are ordinarily very
general and indefinite in meaning, for example, <i>man</i> conveys only a
very general idea. To make that idea definite we need the help of one or
more descriptive words such as <i>black</i>, <i>tall</i>, <i>stout</i>, <i>good</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I saw a man.</p></div>

<p>gives no definite idea of the person seen.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>I saw a tall, thin, dark, old man.</p></div>

<p>presents a very definite picture. It will be noted that these
descriptive words have a way of forming combinations among themselves.
It must be remembered, however, that all the words thus used describe
the noun. Adjectives are sometimes used as substitutes for nouns. This
is one of the many verbal short cuts in which the English language abounds.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The good die young</p></div>

<p>means good people die young.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>We should seek the good and beautiful</p></div>

<p>means we should seek good or beautiful things, or persons, or qualities, or perhaps everything good and beautiful.</p>

<p>When adjectives indicate a quality they have three forms called degrees
indicating the extent or amount of the quality possessed by the noun
especially as compared with other objects of the same sort, <i>a big man</i>,
<i>a bigger man</i>, <i>the biggest man</i>. These degrees are called positive,
indicating possession of bigness; comparative, indicating possession of
more bigness than some other man; superlative, indicating possession of
more bigness than any other man. When we wish to tell the amount of the
quality without comparing the possessor with any other object or group
of objects we use a modifying word later to be described called an adverb.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I saw a very big man,</p></div>

<p>indicates that the man possessed much bigness, but makes no comparison
with any other man or group of men. Comparison is generally indicated in
two ways, first, by adding to the adjectives the terminations <i>er</i> and
<i>est</i> as <i>high</i>, <i>higher</i>, <i>highest</i>, or, second, by using the words
<i>more</i> and <i>most</i>, as <i>splendid</i>, <i>more splendid</i>, <i>most splendid</i>. The
question which of the two methods should be used is not always easy to
decide. It depends somewhat on usage and on euphony or agreeableness of sound.</p>

<p>Adjectives of three or more syllables use the long form, that is, the
additional word. We should not say <i>beautifuler</i> or <i>beautifulest</i>.
Adjectives of two syllables may often be compared either way; for
example, it would be equally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> correct to say <i>nobler</i> and <i>noblest</i> or
<i>more noble</i> and <i>most noble</i>. An example of the influence of euphony
may be found in the adjective <i>honest</i>. We might say <i>honester</i> without
hesitation but we should be less likely to say <i>honestest</i> on account of
the awkward combination of syllables involved. Adjectives of one
syllable usually take the short form but not invariably. The exceptions,
however, are more common in poetry than in prose. When any question
rises it is usually safer to use the long form of comparison in the case
of two-syllable adjectives and to use the short form in the case of
one-syllable adjectives. The proper use of the long form is one of those
niceties of diction which come only with careful observation and with
training of the ear and of the literary sense.</p>

<p>The word <i>most</i> should never be used, as it often is, in the place of
<i>almost</i>. Careless people say "I am most ready" meaning "I am almost, or
nearly ready." The phrase "I am most ready," really means "I am in the
greatest possible readiness." Such use of <i>most</i> is common in old
English but much less so in modern speech.</p>

<p>Two very common adjectives are irregularly compared. They are <i>good</i>,
<i>better</i>, <i>best</i>, and <i>bad</i>, <i>worse</i>, <i>worst</i>. In spite of the fact that
these adjectives are among the most common in use and their comparison
may be supposed to be known by everybody, one often hears the
expressions <i>gooder</i>, <i>goodest</i>, <i>more better</i>, <i>bestest</i>, <i>bader</i>,
<i>badest</i>, <i>worser</i>, and <i>worsest</i>. Needless to say, these expressions
are without excuse except that <i>worser</i> is sometimes found in old English.</p>

<p>Illiterate people sometimes try to make their speech more forceful by
combining the two methods of comparison in such expressions as <i>more
prettier</i>, <i>most splendidest</i>. Such compounds should never be used.</p>

<p>Some adjectives are not compared. They are easily identified by their
meaning. They indicate some quality which is of such a nature that it
must be possessed fully or not at all, <i>yearly</i>, <i>double</i>, <i>all</i>. Some
adjectives have a precise meaning in which they cannot be compared and a
loose or popular one in which they can be; for example, a thing either
is or is not <i>round</i> or <i>square</i>. Nevertheless we use these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> words in
such a loose general way that it is not absolutely incorrect to say
<i>rounder</i> and <i>roundest</i> or <i>squarer</i> and <i>squarest</i>. Such expressions
should be used with great care and avoided as far as possible. None but
the very ignorant would say <i>onliest</i>, but one often sees the
expressions <i>more</i> and <i>most unique</i>. This is particularly bad English.
Unique does not mean <i>rare</i>, <i>unusual</i>; it means one of a kind,
absolutely unlike anything else. Clearly this is a quality which cannot
be possessed in degrees. An object either does or does not have it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><a name="Articles" id="Articles"></a><i>Articles</i></p>

<p>An article is a little adjective which individualizes the noun, <i>a</i> boy, <i>an</i> apple, <i>the</i> crowd.</p>

<p><i>A</i> which is used before consonantal sounds and <i>an</i> which is used before vowel sounds are called indefinite articles because they
individualize without specializing. <i>The</i> is called the definite article because it both individualizes and specializes.</p>

<p><i>A</i> may be used before <i>o</i> and <i>u</i> if the sound is really consonantal as
in <i>such a one</i>, <i>a use</i>, <i>a utility</i>. <i>An</i> may be used before <i>h</i> if
the <i>h</i> is not sounded, for example, <i>an hour</i> but <i>a horror</i>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><a name="Verbs" id="Verbs"></a><i>Verbs</i></p>

<p>A verb is a word which asserts or declares. In other words, it makes a
noun or pronoun tell something. <i>John paper</i> tells nothing. <i>John wastes
paper</i> tells something. Verbs are the most difficult of all the parts of
speech to understand and to use properly. As a rule, an English verb has
something more than fifty parts which, with their uses, should be
thoroughly learned from a grammar. This is not so difficult a matter as
it might appear, except to those whose native speech is not English.
Nevertheless you should be on the guard against such blunders as <i>I
seen</i>, <i>I seed</i>, for <i>I saw</i>, <i>I runned</i> for <i>I ran</i>, <i>I et</i> for <i>I
ate</i>, <i>I throwed</i> for <i>I threw</i>, and the like. In most verbs these parts
are regular. In some they are irregular. A list of irregular verbs will be found at the end of this volume.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>While the plan of this book does not call for a systematic study of
verbs any more than of any other words, it is desirable to call attention to some points as being the occasions of frequent mistakes.</p>

<p>A simple sentence consists of a verb, its subject, and its object. The
verb indicates the action, the subject is the noun (name of a person or
thing) which does the act, the object is the noun to which the thing is
done. Verbs have forms denoting person and number, for example:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" summary="person">
<tr><td align="center">Singular</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td align="center">Plural</td></tr>
<tr><td>1st I love</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>1st We love</td></tr>
<tr><td>2nd You love (thou lovest)<br /><span style="margin-left: 2em;">formal and archaic.</span></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td valign="top">2nd You love</td></tr>
<tr><td>3rd He loves</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>3rd They love</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">Singular</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td align="center">Plural</td></tr>
<tr><td>1st I was</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>1st We were</td></tr>
<tr><td>2nd You were (thou wast)</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>2nd You were</td></tr>
<tr><td>3rd He was</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>3rd They were</td></tr></table>

<p>Verbs agree with their subjects in person and number. We all know this
but we do not always remember it. Unless you are very careful, you will
find yourself using a singular subject with a plural verb or the
reverse. Mistakes of this sort are particularly liable to happen in the
case of collective nouns, in the use of personal pronouns as subjects,
and in cases where the subject and the verb are far separated in the sentence.</p>

<p>Those forms of the verb which tell whether the subject is acting or is
acted upon are called voices. When the subject is acting the verb is
said to be in the active voice. When the subject is acted upon the verb
is said to be in the passive voice. Verbs in the passive voice have no
objects because the subject, being acted upon, is itself in the place of an object.</p>

<p>Those forms of the verb which tell whether the time of the action is
past, present, or future, are called tenses. They are six, viz.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
Present, I <i>print</i> (<i>am printing</i>) the book.<br />
Past or imperfect, I <i>printed</i> the book.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>Future, I <i>shall print</i> the book.<br />
Perfect, or present perfect, I <i>have printed</i> the book.<br />
Pluperfect or past perfect, I <i>had printed</i> the book before you wrote.<br />
Future perfect, I will notify you when I <i>shall have printed</i> the book.</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When adverbs denoting time are indicated care should be taken to see
that the verb is consistent with the adverb. "I <i>printed</i> it yesterday,"
not "I <i>have printed</i> it yesterday;" "I <i>have not</i> yet <i>printed</i> it,"
not "I <i>did</i> not <i>print</i> it yet;" "I <i>have printed</i> it already," not "I <i>printed</i> it already."</p>

<p>Trouble is sometimes found in choosing the right forms of the verb to be used in subordinate clauses. The rule is:</p>

<p>Verbs in subordinate sentences and clauses must be governed by the tense of the principal verb.</p>

<p>This rule rests on the exact meaning of the forms and words used and its
application can be checked by careful examination of these meanings. "He
<i>said</i> he <i>did</i> it." "He <i>said</i> he <i>would do</i> it." "He <i>says</i> he <i>will</i> do it."</p>

<p>Note that when the statement in the subordinate clause is of universal
application the present tense is always used whatever the tense of the
principal verb. "The lecturer said that warm weather always softens rollers."</p>

<p>Those forms of the verb which tell whether the action is an actual fact, a possibility, a condition, or a command are called moods.</p>

<p>There are three moods, the indicative, subjunctive, and imperative.</p>

<p>The indicative mood indicates that the action is a fact. It is also used in asking questions.</p>

<p>The subjunctive mood is less used in modern than in old English. It is
most commonly found in clauses beginning with <i>if</i>, though <i>if</i> is not
to be regarded as the sign of the subjunctive in any such sense as <i>to</i> is the sign of the infinitive.</p>

<p>The subjunctive <i>were</i> should be used in purely hypothetical clauses such as "If I were in your place."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>The subjunctive <i>be</i> should be used in the hypothesis or supposition of
a scientific demonstration,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>If the triangle A be placed on the triangle B.</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The subjunctive without <i>if</i> is often used in wishes or prayers,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>God forgive him.<br />
O, that my brother were here.</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The subjunctive is sometimes used to express condition,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Had you not been a coward, you would not have run away.</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The imperative mood indicates a command,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Put that on the press.</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The subject of the imperative mood is only expressed when it is emphatic,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Go thou and do likewise.</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Older grammarians speak of a fourth mood called potential. The present
tendency among grammarians is to treat these forms separately. They are
verb phrases which express ability, possibility, obligation, or
necessity. They are formed by the use of the auxiliary verbs <i>may</i>,
<i>can</i>, <i>must</i>, <i>might</i>, <i>could</i>, <i>would</i>, and <i>should</i>, with the infinitive without <i>to</i>.</p>

<p><i>May</i> is used (a) to show that the subject is permitted to do something,
"You may go out," or (b) to indicate possibility or doubtful intention, "I may not go to work tomorrow."</p>

<p><i>Can</i> is used to show that the subject is able to do something, "I can
feed a press." These two forms are often confused, with results which
would be ridiculous if they were not too common to attract attention.
The confusion perhaps arises from the fact that the ability to do a
thing often appears to depend on permission to do it. "May I see a
proof?" means "Have I permission, or will you allow me, to see a proof?"
and is the proper way to put the question. The common question, "Can I
see a proof?" is absurd. Of course you can, if you have normal eyesight.</p>

<p><i>Must</i> shows necessity or obligation.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>You must obey the rules of the office.</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span><i>Ought</i> which is sometimes confounded with <i>must</i> in phrases of this
sort expresses moral obligation as distinguished from necessity.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>You ought to obey the rules of the office,</p></div>

<p>indicates that it is your duty to obey because it is the right thing to do even though no penalty is attached.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>You must obey the rules of the office,</p></div>

<p>indicates that you will be punished if you do not obey.</p>

<p>Those forms of the verb which express the time of the action are called
tenses. No particular difficulty attends the use of the tenses except in
the case of <i>shall</i> and <i>will</i> and <i>should</i> and <i>would</i>.</p>

<p><i>Shall</i> and <i>will</i> are used as follows: In simple statements to express
mere futurity, use <i>shall</i> in the first person, <i>will</i> in the second and
third; to express volition, promise, purpose, determination, or action
which the speaker means to control use <i>will</i> in the first person, <i>shall</i> in the second and third.</p>

<p>The following tables should be learned and practiced in a large variety of combinations.</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" summary="Futurity">
<tr><td colspan="2" align="center">Futurity</td><td><span class="spacer">&nbsp;</span></td><td colspan="2" align="center">Volition, etc.</td></tr>
<tr><td>I shall</td><td>We shall</td><td><span class="spacer">&nbsp;</span></td><td>I will</td><td>We will</td></tr>
<tr><td>You will</td><td>You will</td><td><span class="spacer">&nbsp;</span></td><td>You shall</td><td>You shall</td></tr>
<tr><td>He will</td><td>They will</td><td><span class="spacer">&nbsp;</span></td><td>He shall</td><td>They shall</td></tr></table>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A good example of the misuse of the words is found in the old story of
the foreigner who fell into the water and cried out in terror and
despair "I <i>will</i> drown, nobody <i>shall</i> help me."</p>

<p>In asking questions, for the first person always use <i>shall</i>, for the second and third use the auxiliary expected in the answer.</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" summary="Volition">
<tr><td colspan="3" align="center">Futurity</td></tr>
<tr><td>Shall I (I shall)</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Shall we (We shall)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Shall you (I shall)</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Shall you (We shall)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Will he (He will)</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Will they (They will)</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="3" align="center">Volition, etc.</td></tr>
<tr><td>---- ---</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>---- ---</td></tr>
<tr><td>Will you (I will)</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Will you (We will)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Shall he (He shall)</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Shall he (He shall)</td></tr></table>

<p>In all other cases, as in subordinate clauses <i>shall</i> is used in all
persons to express mere futurity, <i>will</i> to express volition, etc.</p>

<p>In indirect discourse, when the subject of the principal clause is
different from the noun clause, the usage is like that in direct statement, for example,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The teacher says that James will win the medal. (futurity),</p></div>

<p>but when the subject of the principal clause is the same as that of the noun clause, the usage is like that in subordinate clauses,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The teacher says that he shall soon resign. (futurity).</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exceptions. <i>Will</i> is often used in the second person to express an official command.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>You will report to the superintendent at once.</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Shall</i> is sometimes used in the second and third persons in a prophetic sense.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free.</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The use of <i>should</i> and <i>would</i> is in general the same as that of <i>shall</i> and <i>will</i> in indirect statement.</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" summary="should">
<tr><td colspan="3" align="center">Futurity</td></tr>
<tr><td>I should</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>We would</td></tr>
<tr><td>You would</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>You should</td></tr>
<tr><td>He would</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>They should</td></tr></table>

<p>In asking questions use <i>should</i> in the first person to express mere
futurity and <i>would</i> to express volition, etc; in the second and third
persons use the form that is expected in the answer.</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" summary="should2">
<tr><td colspan="5" align="center">Futurity</td></tr>
<tr><td>Should I</td><td>(I should)</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Should we</td><td>(We should)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Should You</td><td>(I should)</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Should You</td><td>(We should)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Would he</td><td>(He would)</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Would they</td><td>(They would)</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="5" align="center">Volition, etc.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Would I</td><td>(I would)</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Would we</td><td>(We would)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Would You</td><td>(You would)</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Would You</td><td>(We would)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Should he</td><td>(He should)</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Should they</td><td>(They should)</td></tr></table>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In subordinate clauses <i>should</i> is used in all persons to express futurity, <i>would</i> to express volition, etc.</p>

<p>In indirect discourse the usage is similar to that in direct statement.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The teacher said that John would win the medal.</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exceptions. <i>Should</i> is often used to express moral obligation.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>You should be honest under all conditions.</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Would</i> is sometimes used to express frequentive action.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He would walk the floor night after night.</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mistakes are often made in the use of compound tenses on account of failure to grasp the meaning of the words used.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I should have liked to have seen you,</p></div>

<p>is correct grammar but probably not correct statement of fact, as it
states a past desire to have done something at a period still further
remote, that is to say, "I should have liked (yesterday) to have seen
you (day before yesterday)." What is generally meant is either "I should
have liked to see you," that is "I (then) wished to see you," or "I
should like to have seen you," that is "I (now) wish I had seen you (then)."</p>

<p>Every word has its own value and nearly all our mistakes arise from lack of regard for the exact value of the words to be used.</p>

<p>Where a participial construction is used as the object of a verb, the
noun or pronoun in the object should be in the possessive case and not
in the objective. You should not say, "I object to him watching me," but "I object to his watching me."</p>

<p>Care should be taken not to give objects to passive verbs. The very
common expression "The man was given a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> chance" is incorrect. It should
be "A chance was given to the man."</p>

<p>Care should also be taken to avoid the omission of the prepositions
which are needed with certain verbs, for example, "beware the dog,"
"What happened him" should be "beware <i>of</i> the dog," "What happened <i>to</i> him."</p>

<p>On the other hand superfluous prepositions are sometimes used in such phrases as <i>consider of</i>, <i>accept of</i> and the like.</p>

<p>Such errors are to be avoided by careful study of the meaning of words and careful observation of the best written and spoken speech.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><a name="Pronouns" id="Pronouns"></a><i>Pronouns</i></p>

<p>Pronouns are substitutes for nouns. They are labor saving devices. We
could say everything which we need to say without them, but at the
expense of much repetition of longer words. A child often says "John
wants Henry's ball" instead of "I want your ball." Constant remembrance
of this simple fact, that a pronoun is only a substitute for a noun, is
really about all that is needed to secure correct usage after the
pronouns themselves have once become familiar. A construction which
appears doubtful can often be decided by substituting nouns for pronouns and vice versa.</p>

<p>A very common error is the use of the plural possessive pronouns with
the words <i>any</i>, <i>every</i>, <i>each</i>, <i>somebody</i>, <i>everybody</i>, and <i>nobody</i>, all of which are always singular.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>We could accomplish this if every one would do their part.</p></div>

<p>is wrong. It should be</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>We could accomplish this if every one would do his part.</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another common mistake is the confusion of the nominative and objective
cases in objective clauses where two pronouns or a noun and a pronoun
occur.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>All this was done for you and I.</p></div>

<p>is a very common but entirely inexcusable mistake. One would hardly think of saying</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"All this was done for I."<br />
I saw John and he leaving the shop.</p></div>

<p>is almost equally common and quite equally bad. Do not allow yourself to be confused by a double object.</p>

<p>In general great care should be taken to avoid ambiguity in the use of
pronouns. It is very easy to multiply and combine pronouns in such a way
that while grammatical rules may not be broken the reader may be left
hopelessly confused. Such ambiguous sentences should be cleared up,
either by a rearrangement of the words or by substitution of nouns for some of the pronouns.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><a name="Adverbs" id="Adverbs"></a><i>Adverbs</i></p>

<p>An adverb is a helper to a verb, "I fear greatly," "that press works
badly." Adverbs modify or help verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs just
as adjectives modify nouns and pronouns. The use of adverbs presents
some difficulties, mainly arising from the adverbial use of many other
parts of speech and from the close relation between adverbs and adjectives.</p>

<p>It should never be forgotten that while adverbs never modify nouns or
pronouns, adjectives never modify anything but nouns or pronouns.
Remembrance of this simple fact will settle most questions as to the use
of adverbs or adjectives. Careful observation and care in forming
correct habits of expression will do the rest.</p>

<p>Do not multiply negatives. They cancel each other like the factors in an
arithmetical problem. "He never did wrong" is correct in statement and
clear in meaning. "He never did nothing wrong" does not add force, it
reverses the meaning. The negatives have cancelled each other and you
are saying "He did wrong." "He never did nothing wrong to nobody" leaves
us with an odd negative and brings us back to the first statement, very
badly expressed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>
<p class="center"><a name="Prepositions" id="Prepositions"></a><i>Prepositions</i></p>

<p>A preposition is a hook for a noun or pronoun to hang on. It usually
precedes the noun or pronoun which hangs, or depends upon it, as
indicated by its name which is derived from the Latin <i>pre</i>-before and <i>pono</i>-I place.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>John is behind the press.<br />
I shall work until Sunday.</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A preposition shows the relation of a noun or pronoun used as its object
to some other word or words in the sentence or, as it has been otherwise
stated, makes the noun or pronoun to which it is joined equivalent to an
adjective or an adverb. The expression "John is behind the press" is
equivalent to an adjective describing John. That is, he is "John
behind-the-press." Prepositions are governing words and the words
governed by or depending on them are always in the objective case.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><a name="Conjunctions" id="Conjunctions"></a><i>Conjunctions</i></p>

<p>A conjunction is the coupling link between the parts of a train of thought. It is of no purpose whatever except to connect.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I am cold and hungry and tired and I am going home.</p></div>

<p>Care should be taken to avoid confusing <i>and</i> and <i>but</i> and <i>and</i> and <i>or</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He sees the right and does the wrong.</p></div>

<p>should be</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He sees the right but does the wrong.</p></div>

<p>The ideas are contrasted, not associated.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I did not see Thomas and John.</p></div>

<p>should be</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I did not see Thomas or John.</p></div>

<p>The first phrase means that I did not see them together, it says nothing about seeing them separately.</p>

<p><i>Either</i>&mdash;<i>or</i> and <i>neither</i>&mdash;<i>nor</i> are called correlative conjunctions.
They should always be paired in this way. <i>Neither</i> should never be
paired with <i>or</i> nor <i>either</i> with <i>nor</i>. Each<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> member of the pair
should be placed in the same relative position, that is before the same part of speech.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I could neither see him nor his father.</p></div>

<p>is wrong. It should be</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I could see neither him nor his father.</p></div>

<p>This rule applies to all other correlatives, that is since they are
correlatives in form they should be correlatives in position also. It is correct to say</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It belongs both to you and to me.</p></div>

<p>or</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It belongs to both you and me.</p></div>

<p>but not</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It belongs both to you and me.</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><a name="Interjections" id="Interjections"></a><i>Interjections</i></p>

<p>An interjection is a word or sound expressing emotion only such as a
shout, a groan, a hiss, a sob, or the like, such as <i>Oh</i>, <i>alas</i>, <i>hush</i>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><a name="General_Notes" id="General_Notes"></a><i>General Notes</i></p>

<p>The position of words in a sentence is often very important.
Misplacement will frequently cause ambiguities and absurdities which
punctuation will not remove. What does the phrase "I only saw him" mean?
A newspaper advertisement describing a certain dog which was offered for
sale says "He is thoroughly house-broken, will eat anything, is very
fond of children." As a rule modifiers should be kept close to the
words, clauses, or phrases which they modify, but due regard should be given to sense and to ease of expression.</p>

<p>A word or phrase which can be easily supplied from the context may often
be omitted. Care must be used in making these omissions or the result will be either ambiguous or slovenly.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Washington is nearer New York than Chicago.</p></div>

<p>What exactly does this mean? One might get into serious trouble over the
interpretation of the phrase "He likes me better than you."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span><i>All day</i> and <i>all night</i> are recognized as good expressions sanctioned
by long usage. <i>All morning</i> and <i>all afternoon</i> are not yet sanctioned
by good usage and give a decided impression of slovenliness.</p>

<p>Another objectionable omission is that of <i>to</i> before <i>place</i> and
similar words in such expressions as "Let's go some place" and the like.
It should be <i>to some place</i> or, generally better, <i>somewhere</i>.</p>

<p>A decidedly offensive abbreviation is the phrase <i>Rev. Smith</i>. It should
be <i>Rev. John Smith</i> or <i>Rev. Mr. Smith</i>. <i>Rev.</i> is not a title, or a
noun in apposition, but an adjective. It would be entirely correct to
say <i>Pastor Smith</i> or <i>Bishop Smith</i>. The same error sometimes occurs in using the prefix <i>Hon.</i></p>

<p>A knowledge of the correct use and combination of words is fully as
important as a knowledge of their grammatical forms and their relations.
This knowledge should be acquired by the use of books on rhetoric and by
careful study of words themselves. The materials for such study may be
found in the books named in the "Supplementary Reading" or in other books of a similar character.</p>

<p>The task of the writer or speaker is to say what he has to say
correctly, clearly, and simply. He must say just what he means. He must
say it definitely and distinctly. He must say it, so far as the subject
matter will permit, in words that people of ordinary intelligence and
ordinary education cannot misunderstand. "The right word in the right
place" should be the motto of every man who speaks or writes, and this
rule should apply to his everyday talk as well as to more formal utterances.</p>

<p>Three abuses are to be avoided.</p>

<p>Do not use slang as a means of expression. There are occasions when a
slang phrase may light up what you are saying or may carry it home to
intellects of a certain type. Use it sparingly if at all, as you would
use cayenne pepper or tabasco sauce. Do not use it in writing at all.
Slang is the counterfeit coin of speech. It is a substitute, and a very
poor substitute, for language. It is the refuge of those who neither
understand real language nor know how to express themselves in it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>Do not use long, unusual words. Use short and simple words whenever they
will serve your turn. It is a mistake to suppose that a fluent use of
long words is a mark either of depth of thought or of extent of
information. The following bit of nonsense is taken from the news
columns of a newspaper of good standing: "The topography about Puebla
avails itself easily to a force which can utilize the heights above the
city with cannon." What was meant was probably something like this, "The
situation of Puebla is such as to give a great advantage to a force
which can plant cannon on the high ground overlooking the city."</p>

<p>Do not use inflated or exaggerated words.</p>

<p>A <i>heavy shower</i> is not a <i>cloud burst</i>; a <i>gale</i> is not a <i>blizzard</i>; a
<i>fire</i> is not a <i>conflagration</i>; an <i>accident</i> or a <i>defeat</i> is not a
<i>disaster</i>; a <i>fatal accident</i> is not a <i>holocaust</i>; a <i>sharp criticism</i> is not an <i>excoriation</i> or <i>flaying</i>, and so on.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><a name="Rules" id="Rules"></a><i>Rules for Correct Writing</i></p>

<p>More than a century ago the great Scotch rhetorician Campbell framed
five canons or rules for correct writing. They have never been improved.
They should be learned by heart, thoroughly mastered, and constantly
practiced by every writer and speaker. They are as follows:</p>

<p>Canon 1.&mdash;When, of two words or phrases in equally good use, one is
susceptible of two significations and the other of but one, preference
should be given to the latter: e. g., <i>admittance</i> is better than
<i>admission</i>, as the latter word also means <i>confession</i>; <i>relative</i> is
to be preferred to <i>relation</i>, as the latter also means the telling of a story.</p>

<p>Canon 2.&mdash;In doubtful cases regard should be given to the analogy of the
language; <i>might better</i> should be preferred to <i>had better</i>, and <i>would
rather</i> is better than <i>had rather</i>.</p>

<p>Canon 3.&mdash;The simpler and briefer form should be preferred, other things
being equal, e. g., omit the bracketed words in expressions such as,
<i>open</i> (<i>up</i>), <i>meet</i> (<i>together</i>), <i>follow</i> (<i>after</i>), <i>examine</i>
(<i>into</i>), <i>trace</i> (<i>out</i>), <i>bridge</i> (<i>over</i>), <i>crave</i> (<i>for</i>), etc.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>Canon 4.&mdash;Between two forms of expression in equally good use, prefer
the one which is more euphonious: e. g., <i>most beautiful</i> is better than
<i>beautifullest</i>, and <i>more free</i> is to be preferred to <i>freer</i>.</p>

<p>Canon 5.&mdash;In cases not covered by the four preceding canons, prefer that
which conforms to the older usage: e. g., <i>begin</i> is better than <i>commence</i>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><a name="Sentence" id="Sentence"></a><i>The Sentence</i></p>

<p>The proper construction of sentences is very important to good writing.
The following simple rules will be of great assistance in sentence
formation. They should be carefully learned and the pupil should be drilled in them.</p>

<p>1. Let each sentence have one, and only one, principal subject of thought. Avoid heterogeneous sentences.</p>

<p>2. The connection between different sentences must be kept up by adverbs
used as conjunctions, or by means of some other connecting words at the beginning of the sentence.</p>

<p>3. The connection between two long sentences or paragraphs sometimes
requires a short intervening sentence showing the transition of thought.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><a name="Paragraph" id="Paragraph"></a><i>The Paragraph</i></p>

<p>The proper construction of paragraphs is also of great importance. The
following rules will serve as guides for paragraphing. They should be
learned and the pupil should be drilled in their application.</p>

<p>1. A sentence which continues the topic of the sentence which precedes
it rather than introduces a new topic should never begin a paragraph.</p>

<p>2. Each paragraph should possess a single central topic to which all the
statements in the paragraph should relate. The introduction of a single
statement not so related to the central topic violates the unity.</p>

<p>3. A sentence or short passage may be detached from the paragraph to
which it properly belongs if the writer wishes particularly to emphasize
it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>4. For ease in reading, a passage which exceeds three hundred words in
length may be broken into two paragraphs, even though no new topic has been developed.</p>

<p>5. Any digression from the central topic, or any change in the viewpoint in considering the central topic, demands a new paragraph.</p>

<p>6. Coherence in a paragraph requires a natural and logical order of development.</p>

<p>7. Smoothness of diction in a paragraph calls for the intelligent use of
proper connective words between closely related sentences. A common
fault, however, is the incorrect use of such words as <i>and</i> or <i>but</i>
between sentences which are not closely related.</p>

<p>8. In developing the paragraph, emphasis is secured by a careful
consideration of the relative values of the ideas expressed, giving to
each idea space proportionate to its importance to the whole. This secures the proper climax.</p>

<p>9. The paragraph, like the composition itself, should possess clearness,
unity, coherence, and emphasis. It is a group of related sentences
developing a central topic. Its length depends upon the length of the
composition and upon the number of topics to be discussed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><a name="Arrangement_of_Words" id="Arrangement_of_Words"></a><i>Rules for the Use and Arrangement of Words</i></p>

<p>The following rules for the use and arrangement of words will be found helpful in securing clearness and force.</p>

<p>1. Use words in their proper sense.</p>

<p>2. Avoid useless circumlocution and "fine writing."</p>

<p>3. Avoid exaggerations.</p>

<p>4. Be careful in the use of <i>not</i> ... <i>and</i>, <i>any</i>, <i>but</i>, <i>only</i>, <i>not</i> ... <i>or</i>, <i>that</i>.</p>

<p>5. Be careful in the use of ambiguous words, e. g., <i>certain</i>.</p>

<p>6. Be careful in the use of <i>he</i>, <i>it</i>, <i>they</i>, <i>these</i>, etc.</p>

<p>7. Report a speech in the first person where necessary to avoid ambiguity.</p>

<p>8. Use the third person where the exact words of the speaker are not intended to be given.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>9. When you use a participle implying <i>when</i>, <i>while</i>, <i>though</i>, or
<i>that</i>, show clearly by the context what is implied.</p>

<p>10. When using the relative pronoun, use <i>who</i> or <i>which</i>, if the meaning is <i>and he</i> or <i>and it</i>, <i>for he</i> or <i>for it</i>.</p>

<p>11. Do not use <i>and which</i> for <i>which</i>.</p>

<p>12. Repeat the antecedent before the relative where the non-repetition causes any ambiguity.</p>

<p>13. Use particular for general terms. Avoid abstract nouns.</p>

<p>14. Avoid verbal nouns where verbs can be used.</p>

<p>15. Use particular persons instead of a class.</p>

<p>16. Do not confuse metaphor.</p>

<p>17. Do not mix metaphor with literal statement.</p>

<p>18. Do not use poetic metaphor to illustrate a prosaic subject.</p>

<p>19. Emphatic words must stand in emphatic positions; i. e., for the most part, at the beginning or the end of the sentence.</p>

<p>20. Unemphatic words must, as a rule, be kept from the end.</p>

<p>21. The Subject, if unusually emphatic, should often be transferred from the beginning of the sentence.</p>

<p>22. The object is sometimes placed before the verb for emphasis.</p>

<p>23. Where several words are emphatic make it clear which is the most emphatic. Emphasis can sometimes be given by adding an epithet, or an intensifying word.</p>

<p>24. Words should be as near as possible to the words with which they are grammatically connected.</p>

<p>25. Adverbs should be placed next to the words they are intended to qualify.</p>

<p>26. <i>Only</i>; the strict rule is that <i>only</i> should be placed before the word it affects.</p>

<p>27. When <i>not only</i> precedes <i>but also</i> see that each is followed by the same part of speech.</p>

<p>28. <i>At least</i>, <i>always</i>, and other adverbial adjuncts sometimes produce ambiguity.</p>

<p>29. Nouns should be placed near the nouns that they define.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>30. Pronouns should follow the nouns to which they refer without the intervention of any other noun.</p>

<p>31. Clauses that are grammatically connected should be kept as close together as possible. Avoid parentheses.</p>

<p>32. In conditional sentences the antecedent or "if-clauses" must be kept distinct from the consequent clauses.</p>

<p>33. Dependent clauses preceded by <i>that</i> should be kept distinct from those that are independent.</p>

<p>34. Where there are several infinitives those that are dependent on the same word must be kept distinct from those that are not.</p>

<p>35. In a sentence with <i>if</i>, <i>when</i>, <i>though</i>, etc. put the "if-clause" first.</p>

<p>36. Repeat the subject where its omission would cause obscurity or ambiguity.</p>

<p>37. Repeat a preposition after an intervening conjunction especially if a verb and an object also intervene.</p>

<p>38. Repeat conjunctions, auxiliary verbs, and pronominal adjectives.</p>

<p>39. Repeat verbs after the conjunctions <i>than</i>, <i>as</i>, etc.</p>

<p>40. Repeat the subject, or some other emphatic word, or a summary of what has been said, if the sentence is so long that it is difficult to
keep the thread of meaning unbroken.</p>

<p>41. Clearness is increased when the beginning of the sentence prepares
the way for the middle and the middle for the end, the whole forming a kind of ascent. This ascent is called "climax."</p>

<p>42. When the thought is expected to ascend but descends, feebleness, and sometimes confusion, is the result. The descent is called "bathos."</p>

<p>43. A new construction should not be introduced unexpectedly.</p>

<p class="center"><a name="Common_Errors" id="Common_Errors"></a><i>Common Errors in the Use of Words</i></p>

<p>The following pages contain a short list of the more common errors in
the use of words. Such a list might be extended almost indefinitely. It
is only attempted to call<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> attention to such mistakes as are, for
various reasons, most liable to occur.</p>

<p><i>A</i> should be repeated for every individual. "A red and black book" means one book, "a red and a black book" means two.</p>

<p><i>Abbreviate</i>, and <i>abridge</i>; <i>abbreviation</i> is the shortening of a piece
of writing no matter how accomplished. An <i>abridgement</i> is a condensation.</p>

<p><i>Ability</i>, power to do something, should be distinguished from <i>capacity</i>, power to receive something.</p>

<p><i>Above</i> should not be used as an adjective, e. g., "The statement made
in <i>above</i> paragraph." Substitute <i>preceding</i>, <i>foregoing</i>, or some similar adjective.</p>

<p><i>Accept</i>, not <i>accept of</i>.</p>

<p><i>Accredit</i>, to give one credentials should be distinguished from <i>credit</i>, to believe what one says.</p>

<p><i>Administer</i> is often misused. One <i>administers</i> a dose of medicine, the
laws, an oath, or the government; one does not <i>administer</i> a blow.</p>

<p><i>Administer to</i> is often incorrectly used for <i>minister to</i>, e. g., "The red cross nurse <i>administers to</i> the wounded."</p>

<p><i>Admire</i> should not be used to express delight, as in the phrase "I should <i>admire</i> to do so."</p>

<p><i>Admit</i> should be distinguished from <i>confess</i>.</p>

<p><i>Advent</i> should be distinguished from <i>arrival</i>, <i>advent</i> meaning an epoch-making <i>arrival</i>.</p>

<p><i>Affable</i> means "easy to speak to" and should not be confused with <i>agreeable</i>.</p>

<p><i>Affect</i> should be distinguished from <i>effect</i>. To <i>affect</i> is to influence; to <i>effect</i> is to cause or bring about.</p>

<p><i>Aggravate</i> should not be used for <i>annoy</i> or <i>vex</i> or <i>provoke</i>. It means "to make worse."</p>

<p><i>Ain't</i> is a corruption of <i>am not</i>. It is inelegant though grammatical to say I <i>ain't</i> but absolutely incorrect in other persons and numbers.</p>

<p><i>Alike</i> should not be accompanied by <i>both</i> as in the phrase "They are <i>both alike</i> in this respect."</p>

<p><i>All</i>, <i>All right</i> should never be written <i>alright</i>. <i>All</i> and
<i>universally</i> should never be used together. <i>All</i> should not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> be
accompanied by <i>of</i>, e. g., "He received <i>all of</i> the votes." Be careful
about the use of <i>all</i> in negative statements. Do not say "All present
are not printers" when you mean "Not all present are printers." The
first statement means there are no printers present, the second means there are some printers present.</p>

<p><i>Allege</i> is a common error for <i>say</i>, <i>state</i>, and the like. It means
"to declare," "to affirm," or "to assert with the idea of positiveness" and is not applicable to ordinary statements not needing emphasis.</p>

<p><i>Allow</i> means <i>permit</i>, never <i>think</i> or <i>admit</i>.</p>

<p><i>Allude to</i> is not the same as <i>mention</i>. A person or thing alluded to is not mentioned but indirectly implied.</p>

<p><i>Alone</i> which means <i>unaccompanied</i> should be distinguished from <i>only</i> which means <i>no other</i>.</p>

<p><i>Alternative</i> should never be used in speaking of more than two things.</p>

<p><i>Altogether</i> is not the same as <i>all together</i>.</p>

<p><i>Among</i> should not be used with <i>one another</i>, e. g., "They divided the spoil <i>among one another</i>." It should be "among themselves."</p>

<p><i>And</i> should not be placed before a relative pronoun in such a position
as to interfere with the construction. It should not be substituted for <i>to</i> in such cases as "Try <i>and</i> take more exercise."</p>

<p><i>And which</i> should not be used for <i>which</i>.</p>

<p><i>Another</i> should be followed by <i>than</i> not <i>from</i>, e. g., "Men of another temper <i>from</i> (<i>than</i>) the Greeks."</p>

<p><i>Answer</i> is that which is given to a question; <i>reply</i> to an assertion.</p>

<p><i>Anticipate</i> should not be used in the sense of <i>expect</i>. It means "to forestall."</p>

<p><i>Anxious</i> should not be confused with <i>desirous</i>. It means "feeling anxiety."</p>

<p><i>Any</i> is liable to ambiguity unless it is used with care. "Any of them"
may be either singular or plural. "It is not intended for <i>any</i> machine"
may mean "There is no machine for which it is intended," or "It is not
intended for every machine, but only for a special type."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span><i>Anybody else's</i>, idiomatic and correct.</p>

<p><i>Anyhow</i>, bad, do not use it.</p>

<p><i>Apparently</i> is used of what seems to be real but may not be so. It
should not be confused with <i>evidently</i> which is used of what both seems
to be and is real.</p>

<p><i>Appear</i> is physical in its meaning and should be distinguished from
<i>seem</i> which expresses a mental experience. "The forest <i>appears</i> to be
impenetrable," "This does not <i>seem</i> to me to be right."</p>

<p><i>Apt</i> means "skilful" and should never be used in place of <i>likely</i> or <i>liable</i>. It also means "having a natural tendency."</p>

<p><i>As</i> should not be used as a causal conjunction, e. g., "Do not expect
me <i>as</i> I am too uncertain of my time." The word <i>as</i> stands here as a
contraction of inasmuch. Substitute a semicolon, or make two sentences.</p>

<p><i>As to</i> is redundant in such expressions as "<i>As to</i> how far we can trust him I cannot say."</p>

<p><i>At</i> is often incorrectly used for <i>in</i>, e. g., "He lives <i>at</i> Chicago." It is also improperly used in such expressions as "Where is he <i>at</i>?"</p>

<p><i>As that</i> should not be used for <i>that</i> alone. Do not say "So <i>as that</i> such and such a thing may happen."</p>

<p><i>Audience</i> is not the same as <i>spectators</i>. An <i>audience</i> listens;
<i>spectators</i> merely see. A concert has an <i>audience</i>; a moving picture show has <i>spectators</i>.</p>

<p><i>Aught</i> means "anything" and should not be confused with <i>naught</i> or the symbol <i>0</i> which means "nothing."</p>

<p><i>Avenge</i> means to redress wrongs done to others; <i>revenge</i> wrong done to
ourselves. <i>Avenge</i> usually implies just retribution. <i>Revenge</i> may be used of malicious retaliation.</p>

<p><i>Avocation</i> should not be confused with <i>vocation</i>. A man's <i>vocation</i>
is his principal occupation. His <i>avocation</i> is his secondary occupation.</p>

<p><i>Aware</i> is not the same as <i>conscious</i>. We are <i>aware</i> of things outside
of ourselves; we are <i>conscious</i> of sensations or things within ourselves.</p>

<p><i>Awful</i> and <i>awfully</i> are two very much abused words. They mean "awe
inspiring" and should never be used in any other sense.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span><i>Badly</i> should not be used for <i>very much</i>. It should not be confused
with the adjective <i>bad</i>. "He looks badly" means he makes a bad use of his eyes, say "He looks bad."</p>

<p><i>Bank on</i> is slang. Say <i>rely on</i> or <i>trust in</i>.</p>

<p><i>Beg</i> is often incorrectly used in the sense of <i>beg leave</i>, not "I <i>beg</i> to say" but "I <i>beg leave</i> to say."</p>

<p><i>Beside</i>, meaning "by the side of" should not be confused with <i>besides</i> meaning "in addition to."</p>

<p><i>Between</i> applies only to two persons or things.</p>

<p><i>Blame on</i> as a verb should never be used.</p>

<p><i>Both</i>, when <i>both&mdash;and</i> are used be sure they connect the right words,
"He can both spell and punctuate" not "He both can spell and punctuate."
Do not use such expressions as "They both resemble each other." Be
careful to avoid confusion in the use of negative statements. Do not say
"Both cannot go" when you mean that one can go.</p>

<p><i>Bound</i> in the sense of <i>determined</i> is an Americanism and is better
avoided. We say "he is <i>bound</i> to do it" meaning "he is <i>determined</i> to
do it," but the phrase really means "He is under bonds, or obligation to do it."</p>

<p><i>Bring</i> should be carefully distinguished from <i>fetch</i>, <i>carry</i> and
<i>take</i>. <i>Bring</i> means to transfer toward the speaker. <i>Fetch</i> means to
go and bring back. <i>Carry</i> and <i>take</i> mean to transfer from the speaker,
e. g., "<i>Bring</i> a book home from the library." "<i>Fetch</i> me a glass of
water." "<i>Carry</i> this proof to the proofreader." "<i>Take</i> this book home."</p>

<p><i>But</i> is sometimes used as a preposition and when so used takes the
objective case. "The boy stood on the burning deck whence all <i>but</i> him
had fled." <i>But</i> should not be used in connection with <i>that</i> unless
intended to express the opposite of what the meaning would be without
it, e. g., "I have no doubt <i>but that</i> he will die" is incorrect because
his death is expected. "I have no fear <i>but that</i> he will come" is
correct, as the meaning intended is "I am sure he will come."</p>

<p><i>But what</i> is often incorrectly used for <i>but that</i>. "I cannot believe
<i>but what</i> he is guilty" probably means "I can but believe that he is
guilty." "I <i>cannot but</i> believe" means "I must believe."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span><i>Calculate</i> does not mean <i>think</i> or <i>suppose</i>.</p>

<p><i>Calculated</i> does not mean <i>likely</i>. It means "intended or planned for the purpose."</p>

<p><i>Can</i> which indicates ability is to be distinguished from <i>may</i> which indicates permission.</p>

<p><i>Cannot but</i> should be carefully distinguished from <i>can but</i>, e. g., "I
<i>can but</i> try" means "All I can do is try." "I <i>cannot but try</i>" means "I cannot help trying."</p>

<p><i>Can't seem</i> should not be used for <i>seem unable</i>, e. g., "I <i>can't seem</i> to see it."</p>

<p><i>Childlike</i> should be carefully distinguished from <i>childish</i>. <i>Childish</i> refers particularly to the weakness of the child.</p>

<p><i>Come</i> should not be confused with <i>Go</i>. <i>Come</i> denotes motion toward
the speaker; <i>go</i> motion from the speaker, "If you will come to see me, I will go to see you."</p>

<p><i>Common</i> should be distinguished from <i>mutual</i>. <i>Common</i> means "shared
in common." <i>Mutual</i> means "reciprocal" and can refer to but two persons
or things. A <i>common</i> friend is a friend two or more friends have in
common. <i>Mutual</i> friendship is the friendship of two persons for each other.</p>

<p><i>Compare to</i>, <i>liken to</i>, <i>compare with</i>, means "measure by" or "point out similarities and differences."</p>

<p><i>Condign</i> means "suitable" or "deserved," not necessarily <i>severe</i>.</p>

<p><i>Condone</i> means "to forgive" or "nullify by word or act," not "make amends for."</p>

<p><i>Consider</i> in the sense of <i>regard as</i> should not usually be followed by <i>as</i>, e. g., "I consider him a wise man," not "<i>as</i> a wise man."</p>

<p><i>Contemptible</i> is used of an object of contempt and it should be
distinguished from <i>contemptuous</i> which is used of what is directed at
such an object, e. g., "He is a <i>contemptible</i> fellow." "I gave him a <i>contemptuous</i> look."</p>

<p><i>Continual</i> should not be confused with <i>continuous</i>. <i>Continual</i> means "frequently repeated." <i>Continuous</i> means "uninterrupted."</p>

<p><i>Convene</i>, which means "to come together," should not be confused with
<i>convoke</i> which means "to bring or call together."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> A legislature
<i>convenes</i>. It cannot be <i>convened</i> by another, but it can be <i>convoked</i>.</p>

<p><i>Crime</i> is often used for offenses against the speaker's sense of right.
Properly <i>crime</i> is a technical word meaning "offenses against law." A
most innocent action may be a <i>crime</i> if it is contrary to a statute.
The most sinful, cruel, or dishonest action is no <i>crime</i> unless prohibited by a statute.</p>

<p><i>Dangerous</i> should not be used for <i>dangerously ill</i>.</p>

<p><i>Data</i> is plural.</p>

<p><i>Deadly</i>, "that which inflicts death" should not be confused with <i>deathly</i>, "that which resembles death."</p>

<p><i>Decided</i> must not be confused with <i>decisive</i>. A <i>decided</i> victory is a
clear and unmistakable victory. A <i>decisive</i> victory is one which decides the outcome of a war or of a campaign.</p>

<p><i>Decimate</i> means to take away one-tenth. It is not properly used in a general way of the infliction of severe losses.</p>

<p><i>Definite</i> which means "well defined" should not be confused with <i>definitive</i> which means "final."</p>

<p><i>Demean</i> is related to <i>demeanor</i> and means "behave." It should be carefully distinguished from <i>degrade</i> or <i>lower</i>.</p>

<p><i>Die.</i> We die <i>of</i> a certain disease, not <i>with</i> or <i>from</i> it.</p>

<p><i>Differ</i> in the sense of disagree is followed by <i>with</i>. "I <i>differ with</i> you." <i>Differ</i> as indicating unlikeness is followed by <i>from</i>.</p>

<p><i>Different</i> should be followed by <i>from</i> never by <i>with</i>, <i>than</i>, or <i>to</i>.</p>

<p><i>Directly</i> should not be used for <i>as soon as</i>.</p>

<p><i>Discover</i>, "to find something which previously existed" should be distinguished from <i>invent</i> something for the first time.</p>

<p><i>Disinterested</i> means "having no financial or material interest in a
thing." It should be carefully distinguished from <i>uninterested</i> which means "taking no interest in" a thing.</p>

<p><i>Dispense</i>, "to distribute" should not be confused with <i>dispense with</i>, "to do without."</p>

<p><i>Disposition</i> is not the same as <i>disposal</i>.</p>

<p><i>Distinguish</i> which means "to perceive differences" should not be
confused with <i>differentiate</i> which means "to make or constitute a difference."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span><i>Divide</i> should be carefully distinguished from <i>distribute</i>.</p>

<p><i>Don't</i> is a contraction of do not. <i>Doesn't</i> is the contraction for does not. <i>I don't</i>, <i>they don't</i>, <i>he doesn't</i>.</p>

<p><i>Due</i> should not be used for <i>owing to</i> or <i>because of</i>.</p>

<p><i>Each</i> is distributive and is always singular. <i>Each other</i> which is
applicable to two only should not be confused with <i>one another</i> which is applicable to more than two.</p>

<p><i>Egotist</i>, a man with a high or conceited opinion of himself, should not
be confused with <i>egoist</i> which is the name for a believer in a certain philosophical doctrine.</p>

<p><i>Either</i> is distributive and therefore singular and should never be used of more than two.</p>

<p><i>Elegant</i> denotes delicacy and refinement and should not be used as a term of general approval.</p>

<p><i>Else</i> should be followed by <i>than</i>, not by <i>but</i>. "No one else <i>than</i> (not <i>but</i>) he could have done so much."</p>

<p><i>Emigrant</i>, one who goes out of a country should not be confused with <i>immigrant</i>, one who comes into a country.</p>

<p><i>Enormity</i> is used of wickedness, cruelty, or horror, not of great size,
for which <i>enormousness</i> should be used. We speak of the <i>enormity</i> of an offence but of the <i>enormousness</i> of a crowd.</p>

<p><i>Enthuse</i> should not be used as a verb.</p>

<p><i>Equally as</i> well; say <i>equally well</i>, or <i>as well</i>.</p>

<p><i>Every place</i> used adverbially should be <i>everywhere</i>.</p>

<p><i>Except</i> should never be used in the sense of <i>unless</i> or <i>but</i>.</p>

<p><i>Exceptional</i> which means "unusual," "forming an exception" should not be confused with <i>exceptionable</i> which means "open to objection."</p>

<p><i>Expect</i> which involves a sense of the future should not be confused
with <i>suppose</i> and similar words, as in the phrase "I <i>expect</i> you know all about it."</p>

<p><i>Factor</i> is not to be confounded with <i>cause</i>.</p>

<p><i>Falsity</i> applies to things, <i>falseness</i> to persons.</p>

<p><i>At fault</i> means "at a loss of what to do next." <i>In fault</i> means "in the wrong."</p>

<p><i>Favor</i> should not be used in the sense of <i>resemble</i>.</p>

<p><i>Female</i> should not be used for <i>woman</i>. The words <i>female</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> <i>woman</i>,
and <i>lady</i> should be used with careful attention to their respective shades of meaning.</p>

<p><i>Few</i>, which emphasizes the fact that the number is small should be
distinguished from <i>a few</i> which emphasizes the fact that there is a
number though it be small. "<i>Few</i> shall part where many meet." "<i>A few</i> persons were saved in the ark."</p>

<p><i>Fewer</i> applies to number; <i>less</i> to quantity.</p>

<p><i>Firstly</i> should not be used for <i>first</i> although secondly and thirdly may be used to complete the series.</p>

<p><i>Fix</i> should not be used in the sense of <i>repair</i>, <i>arrange</i>, or <i>settle</i>.</p>

<p><i>Former</i> and <i>latter</i> should never be used where more than two things are involved.</p>

<p><i>Frequently</i> should be distinguished from commonly, <i>generally</i>,
<i>perpetually</i>, <i>usually</i>. <i>Commonly</i> is the antithesis of <i>rarely</i>,
<i>frequently</i> of <i>seldom</i>, <i>generally</i> of <i>occasionally</i>, <i>usually</i> of <i>casually</i>.</p>

<p><i>Funny</i> should not be used to mean <i>strange</i> or <i>remarkable</i>.</p>

<p><i>Gentleman Friend</i> and <i>Lady Friend</i> are expressions which should be
avoided, say "man or woman friend" or "man or woman of my acquaintance"
or even "gentleman or lady of my acquaintance."</p>

<p><i>Good</i> should not be used in the sense of <i>well</i>. "I feel <i>good</i>."</p>

<p><i>Got</i> is said to be the most misused word in the language. The verb
means to secure by effort and should be used only with this meaning, e. g.,
"I have <i>got</i> the contract." <i>Have got</i> to indicate mere possession
is objectionable. Mere possession is indicated by <i>have</i> alone. Another
common mistake is the use of <i>got</i> to express obligation or constraint. "I have <i>got</i> to do it."</p>

<p><i>Guess</i> should not be used in the sense of <i>think</i> or <i>imagine</i>.</p>

<p><i>Handy</i> should never be used to express nearness.</p>

<p><i>Hanged</i> should be used to express the execution of a human being. <i>Hung</i> is the past participle in all other uses.</p>

<p><i>Hardly.</i> "I <i>can hardly</i> see it," not "I <i>can't hardly</i> see it."</p>

<p><i>Healthy</i> which means "possessed of health" should be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> distinguished
from <i>healthful</i> and <i>wholesome</i> which mean "health giving."</p>

<p><i>High</i> should not be confused with <i>tall</i>.</p>

<p><i>Home</i> is not a synonym for <i>house</i>. A beautiful <i>house</i> is a very different thing from a beautiful <i>home</i>.</p>

<p><i>Honorable</i> as a title should always be preceded by <i>the</i>.</p>

<p><i>How</i> should not be used for <i>what</i>, or for <i>that</i>. It means "in what
manner."</p>

<p><i>How that</i> should not be used when either one will do alone. Such a
sentence as "We have already noted how that Tillotson defied rubrical order...." is very bad.</p>

<p><i>If</i> should not be used in the sense of <i>where</i> or <i>that</i>.</p>

<p><i>Ilk</i> means "the same" not <i>kind</i> or <i>sort</i>.</p>

<p><i>Ill</i> is an adverb as well as an adjective. Do not say illy.</p>

<p><i>In</i> should not be used for <i>into</i> when motion is implied. You ride <i>in</i> a car but you get <i>into</i> it.</p>

<p><i>Inaugurate</i> should not be used for <i>begin</i>.</p>

<p><i>Individual</i> should not be used for <i>person</i>.</p>

<p><i>Inside of</i> should not be used as an expression of time.</p>

<p><i>Invaluable</i>, meaning "of very great value" should not be confused with <i>valueless</i>, meaning "of no value."</p>

<p><i>Invite</i> should not be used for <i>invitation</i>.</p>

<p><i>Kind</i> is not plural. Do not say "These" or "those" <i>kind</i> of things.
<i>Kind of</i> should never be followed by the indefinite article. "What
<i>kind of</i> man is he?" not "What <i>kind of a</i> man is he?" <i>Kind of</i> or
<i>sort of</i> should not be used in the sense of <i>rather</i> or <i>somewhat</i>.</p>

<p><i>Kindly</i> is often misused in such expressions as "You are <i>kindly</i>
requested to recommend a compositor." Undoubtedly the idea of kindness
is attached to the recommendation not to the request and the sentence should be so framed as to express it.</p>

<p><i>Last</i> is often misused for <i>latest</i>. "The <i>last</i> number of the paper"
is not the one that appeared this morning but the one that finally closes publication.</p>

<p><i>Latter</i> applies only to the last of two. If a longer series than two is referred to, say <i>the last</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lay</i>, which is a transitive verb, should not be confused with <i>lie</i>.
<i>Lay</i> is a verb which expresses causitive action; <i>lie</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> expresses
passivity. "He <i>lays</i> plans." "He <i>lies</i> down." The past tense of <i>lay</i> is <i>laid</i>, that of <i>lie</i> is <i>lay</i>.</p>

<p><i>Learn</i> should not be used in place of <i>teach</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lengthy</i> is a very poor substitute for <i>long</i>, which needs no substitute.</p>

<p><i>Liable</i> should not be used for <i>likely</i>. <i>Liable</i> means an unpleasant
probability. <i>Likely</i> means any probability. <i>Liable</i> is also used to express obligation. He is <i>liable</i> for this debt.</p>

<p><i>Like</i> must never be used in the sense of <i>as</i>. "Do <i>like</i> I do" should be "Do <i>as</i> I do."</p>

<p><i>Literally</i> implies that a statement to which it is attached is accurately and precisely true. It is frequently misused.</p>

<p><i>Loan</i> is a noun, not a verb.</p>

<p><i>Locate</i> should not be used in the sense of <i>settle</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lot</i> or <i>lots</i> should not be used to indicate a <i>great deal</i>.</p>

<p><i>Love</i> expresses affection or, in its biblical sense, earnest benevolence. <i>Like</i> expresses taste. Do not say "I should <i>love</i> to go."</p>

<p><i>Lovely</i> means "worthy of affection" and, like <i>elegant</i>, should never be used as a term of general approbation.</p>

<p><i>Luxuriant</i> which means "superabundant in growth or production" should
not be confounded with <i>luxurious</i> which means "given over to luxury." Vegetation is <i>luxuriant</i>, men are <i>luxurious</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mad</i> means <i>insane</i> and is not a synonym for <i>angry</i>.</p>

<p><i>Means</i> may be either singular or plural.</p>

<p><i>Meet</i> should not be used in the sense of <i>meeting</i> except in the case of a few special expressions such as "a race meet."</p>

<p><i>Mighty</i> should not be used in the sense of <i>very</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mind</i> should not be used in the sense of <i>obey</i>.</p>

<p><i>Most</i> should not be used instead of <i>almost</i>, as in such expressions as "It rained <i>most</i> every day."</p>

<p><i>Must</i> should not be used for <i>had to</i> or <i>was obliged</i>. In its proper use it refers to the present or future only.</p>

<p><i>Necessities</i> should be carefully distinguished from <i>necessaries</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span><i>Negligence</i>, which denotes a quality of character should be
distinguished from <i>neglect</i> which means "a failure to act."</p>

<p><i>Neither</i> denotes one of two and should not be used for <i>none</i> or <i>no
one</i>. As a correlative conjunction it should be followed by <i>nor</i> never by <i>or</i>.</p>

<p><i>New beginner</i>. <i>Beginner</i> is enough; all beginners are new.</p>

<p><i>News</i> is singular in construction.</p>

<p><i>Never</i> is sometimes used as an emphatic negative but such usage is not good.</p>

<p><i>Nice</i> should not be used in the sense of <i>pleasant</i> or <i>agreeable</i>.</p>

<p><i>No how</i> should not be used for <i>anyway</i>.</p>

<p><i>No place</i> should be written as <i>nowhere</i>.</p>

<p><i>None</i> should be treated as a singular.</p>

<p><i>Not</i>, like <i>neither</i>, must be followed by the correlative <i>nor</i>, e. g., "Not for wealth nor for fame did he strive."</p>

<p><i>Not</i> ... <i>but</i> to express a negative is a double negative and therefore should not be used, e. g., "I have <i>not</i> had <i>but</i> one meal to-day."</p>

<p><i>Nothing like</i> and <i>nowhere near</i> should not be used for <i>not nearly</i>.</p>

<p><i>O</i> should be used for the vocative and without punctuation.</p>

<p><i>Oh</i> should be used for the ejaculation and should be followed by a comma or an exclamation point.</p>

<p><i>Obligate</i> should not be used for <i>oblige</i>.</p>

<p><i>Observe</i> should not be used for <i>say</i>.</p>

<p><i>Observation</i> should not be used for <i>observance</i>.</p>

<p><i>Of</i> is superfluous in such phrases as <i>smell of</i>, <i>taste of</i>, <i>feel of</i>.</p>

<p><i>Off</i> should never be used with <i>of</i>; one or the other is superfluous.</p>

<p><i>Other</i>. After <i>no other</i> use <i>than</i>, not <i>but</i>.</p>

<p><i>Ought</i> must never be used in connection with <i>had</i> or <i>did</i>. "You
<i>hadn't ought</i> or <i>didn't ought</i> to do it" should be "You ought not to have done it."</p>

<p><i>Out loud</i> should never be used for <i>aloud</i>.</p>

<p><i>Panacea</i> is something that cures all diseases, not an effective remedy for one disease.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span><i>Partake of</i> should not be used in the sense of <i>eat</i>. It means "to share with others."</p>

<p><i>Party</i> should never be used for <i>person</i> except in legal documents.</p>

<p><i>Per</i> should be used in connection with other words of Latin form but
not with English words. <i>Per diem</i>, <i>per annum</i>, and the like are
correct. <i>Per day</i> or <i>per year</i> are incorrect. It should be <i>a day</i>, or <i>a year</i>.</p>

<p><i>Perpendicular</i>, which merely means at right angles to something else mentioned, should not be used for <i>vertical</i>.</p>

<p><i>Plenty</i>, a noun should not be confused with the adjective <i>plentiful</i>.</p>

<p><i>Politics</i> is singular.</p>

<p><i>Post</i> does not mean <i>inform</i>.</p>

<p><i>Predicate</i> should not be used in the sense of <i>predict</i> or in the sense of <i>base</i> or <i>found</i>.</p>

<p><i>Premature</i> means "before the proper time." It should not be used in a general way as equivalent to <i>false</i>.</p>

<p><i>Pretty</i> should not be used in the modifying sense, nor as a synonym for <i>very</i> in such phrases as "pretty good," "pretty near," and the like.</p>

<p><i>Preventative</i>, no such word, say <i>preventive</i>.</p>

<p><i>Promise</i> should not be used in the sense of <i>assure</i>.</p>

<p><i>Propose</i>, meaning "to offer" should not be confused with <i>purpose</i> meaning "to intend."</p>

<p><i>Proposition</i> should not be confounded with <i>proposal</i>. A <i>proposition</i>
is a statement of a statement or a plan. A <i>proposal</i> is the presentation or statement of an offer.</p>

<p><i>Providing</i> should not be used for <i>provided</i>.</p>

<p><i>Quality</i> should never be used as an adjective or with an adjective
sense. "Quality clothes" is meaningless: "Clothes of quality" equally
so. All clothes have quality and the expression has meaning only when
the quality is defined as good, bad, high, low, and so forth.</p>

<p><i>Quit</i>, "to go away from" is not the same as <i>stop</i>.</p>

<p><i>Quite</i> means "entirely," "wholly," and should never be used in the
modifying sense as if meaning <i>rather</i> or <i>somewhat</i>. "Quite a few" is
nonsense.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span><i>Raise</i> is a much abused word. It is never a noun. As a verb it should
be distinguished from <i>rear</i> and <i>increase</i>, as in such phrases as "He
was <i>raised</i> in Texas." "The landlord <i>raised</i> my rent."</p>

<p><i>Rarely ever</i> should not be used for <i>rarely</i> or <i>hardly ever</i>.</p>

<p><i>Real</i> should not be used in the sense of <i>very</i>.</p>

<p><i>Reference</i> should be used with <i>with</i> rather than <i>in</i>. Say <i>with</i>
reference to, not <i>in</i> reference to. The same rule applies to the words
<i>regard</i> and <i>respect</i>. Do not say "<i>in regards to</i>," say "<i>with regard to</i>."</p>

<p><i>Remember</i> is not the same as <i>recollect</i>, which means "to remember by an effort."</p>

<p><i>Rendition</i> should not be used for <i>rendering</i>.</p>

<p><i>Researcher</i> has no standing as a word.</p>

<p><i>Reside</i> in the sense of live, and residence in the sense of house or dwelling are affectations and should never be used.</p>

<p><i>Retire</i> should not be used in the sense of "go to bed."</p>

<p><i>Right</i> should not be used in the sense of <i>duty</i>. "You <i>had a right</i> to
warn me," should be "It was your duty to warn me, or you ought to have
warned me." <i>Right</i> should not be used in the sense of <i>very</i>. Such
expressions as <i>right now</i>, <i>right off</i>, <i>right away</i>, <i>right here</i> are not now in good use.</p>

<p><i>Same</i> should not be used as a pronoun. This is a common usage in
business correspondence but it is not good English and can be easily
avoided without sacrificing either brevity or sense. <i>Same as</i> in the
sense of <i>just as</i>, <i>in the same manner</i> should be avoided.</p>

<p><i>Score</i> should not be used for <i>achieve</i> or <i>accomplish</i>.</p>

<p><i>Set</i> should not be confused with <i>sit</i>. To set means "to cause to sit."</p>

<p><i>Sewage</i>, meaning the contents of a sewer, should not be confused with <i>sewerage</i> which means the system.</p>

<p><i>Show</i> should not be used in the sense of <i>play</i> or <i>performance</i>. <i>Show up</i> should not be used for <i>expose</i>.</p>

<p><i>Since</i> should not be used for <i>ago</i>.</p>

<p><i>Some</i> should not be used for <i>somewhat</i> as "I feel <i>some</i> better."</p>

<p><i>Sort of</i> should not be used for <i>rather</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span><i>Splendid</i> means <i>shining</i> or <i>brilliant</i> and should not be used as a
term of general commendation.</p>

<p><i>Stand for</i> means "be responsible for." Its recent use as meaning
<i>stand</i>, <i>endure</i>, or <i>permit</i>, should be avoided.</p>

<p><i>Start</i> should not be used for <i>begin</i>, e. g., "He <i>started</i> (began) to speak."</p>

<p><i>State</i> should not be used for <i>say</i>.</p>

<p><i>Stop</i> should not be used for <i>stay</i>.</p>

<p><i>Such</i> should not be used for <i>so</i>. Say "I have never seen <i>so</i>
beautiful a book before" not "I have never seen such a beautiful book before."</p>

<p><i>Sure</i> should not be used as an adverb. Say <i>surely</i>.</p>

<p><i>Take</i> is superfluous in connection with other verbs, e. g., "Suppose we
<i>take</i> and <i>use</i> that type." <i>Take</i> should not be confused with <i>bring</i>.
<i>Take stock in</i> should not be used for <i>rely</i> or <i>trust in</i>.</p>

<p><i>That</i> should not be used in the sense of <i>so</i>. "I did not know it was <i>that</i> big."</p>

<p><i>Think</i> should not have the word <i>for</i> added, e. g., "It is more important than you <i>think for</i>."</p>

<p><i>This</i> should not be used as an adverb. "This much is clear" should be "Thus much is clear."</p>

<p><i>Through</i> should not be used for <i>finished</i>.</p>

<p><i>To</i> is superfluous and wrong in such expressions as "Where did you go <i>to</i>?"</p>

<p><i>Too</i> alone should not modify a past participle. "He was <i>too</i> (much) excited to reply."</p>

<p><i>Transpire</i> does not mean <i>happen</i>. It means to come to light or become known.</p>

<p><i>Treat</i> should be followed by <i>of</i> rather than <i>on</i>. This volume treats <i>of</i> grammar, not <i>on</i> grammar.</p>

<p><i>Try</i> should be followed by <i>to</i> rather than <i>and</i>. "I will try <i>to</i> go," not "I will try <i>and</i> go."</p>

<p><i>Ugly</i> should never be used in the sense of <i>bad tempered</i> or <i>vicious</i>. It means "repulsive to the eye."</p>

<p><i>Unique</i> does not mean <i>rare</i>, <i>odd</i>, or <i>unusual</i>. It means alone of its kind.</p>

<p><i>Upward of</i> should not be used in the sense of <i>more than</i>.</p>

<p><i>Venal</i> should not be confused with <i>venial</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span><i>Verbal</i> should not be confused with <i>oral</i>. A <i>verbal</i> message means
only a message in words; an <i>oral</i> message is a message by word of mouth.</p>

<p><i>Very</i> should be used sparingly. It is a word of great emphasis and like
all such words defeats its purpose when used too frequently.</p>

<p><i>Visitor</i> is a human caller. <i>Visitant</i> a supernatural caller.</p>

<p><i>Want</i> should not be used in the sense of <i>wish</i>, e. g., "I <i>want</i> it"
really means "I feel the want of it" or "I lack it." <i>Want</i>, <i>wish</i>, and <i>need</i> should be carefully distinguished.</p>

<p><i>Way</i> should not be used in the sense of <i>away</i> in such expressions as "<i>Way</i> down East."</p>

<p><i>Ways</i> should not be used for <i>way</i>, e. g., "It is quite a <i>ways</i> (way) off."</p>

<p><i>What</i> is often misused for <i>that</i>, e. g., "He has no doubt but <i>what</i> (that) he will succeed."</p>

<p><i>Whence</i> means "from what place or cause" and should not be preceded by
<i>from</i>. This applies equally to hence which means "from this place."</p>

<p><i>Which</i> should not be used with a clause as its antecedent, e. g., "He
replied hotly, <i>which</i> was a mistake" should be "He replied hotly; this
was a mistake." <i>Which</i> being a neuter pronoun should not be used to
represent a masculine or feminine noun. Use who. Between the two neuter
pronouns <i>which</i> and <i>that</i> let euphony decide.</p>

<p><i>Who</i> should not be misused for <i>whom</i> or <i>whose</i>, e. g., "<i>Who</i> (whom)
did you wish to see?" "Washington, than <i>who</i> (whose) no greater name is
recorded." Impersonal objects should be referred to by <i>which</i> rather than <i>who</i>.</p>

<p><i>Without</i> should not be used for <i>unless</i>, e. g., "I will not go <i>without</i> (unless) you go with me."</p>

<p><i>Witness</i> should not be used for <i>see</i>.</p>

<p><i>Worst kind</i> or <i>worst kind of way</i> should not be used for <i>very much</i>.</p>

<p><i>Womanly</i> means "belonging to woman as woman."</p>

<p><i>Womanish</i> means <i>effeminate</i>.</p>

<p>Table 1 contains the principal parts of all irregular verbs whose past tense and perfect participle are unlike.</p>

<p>Most errors in the use of irregular verbs occur with those in Table 1.
The past tense must not be used with <i>have</i> (<i>has</i>, <i>had</i>). Do not use
such expressions as <i>have drove</i> and <i>has went</i>. Equally disagreeable is
the use of the perfect participle for the past tense; as, <i>she seen</i>, <i>they done</i>.</p>

<h3>TYPOGRAPHIC TECHNICAL SERIES FOR APPRENTICES</h3>

<p class='dropcap'><span class="caps">The</span> following list of publications, comprising the <span class="smcap">Typographic Technical
Series for Apprentices</span>, has been prepared under the supervision of the
Committee on Education of the United Typothetae of America for use in
trade classes, in course of printing instruction, and by individuals.</p>

<p>Each publication has been compiled by a competent author or group of
authors, and carefully edited, the purpose being to provide the printers
of the United States&mdash;employers, journeymen, and apprentices&mdash;with a
comprehensive series of handy and inexpensive compendiums of reliable,
up-to-date information upon the various branches and specialties of the
printing craft, all arranged in orderly fashion for progressive study.</p>

<p>The publications of the series are of uniform size, 5 x 8 inches. Their
general make-up, in typography, illustrations, etc., has been, as far as
practicable, kept in harmony throughout. A brief synopsis of the
particular contents and other chief features of each volume will be
found under each title in the following list.</p>

<p>Each topic is treated in a concise manner, the aim being to embody in
each publication as completely as possible all the rudimentary
information and essential facts necessary to an understanding of the
subject. Care has been taken to make all statements accurate and clear,
with the purpose of bringing essential information within the
understanding of beginners in the different fields of study. Wherever
practicable, simple and well-defined drawings and illustrations have
been used to assist in giving additional clearness to the text.</p>

<p>In order that the pamphlets may be of the greatest possible help for use
in trade-school classes and for self-instruction, each title is
accompanied by a list of Review Questions covering essential items of
the subject matter. A short Glossary of technical terms belonging to the
subject or department treated is also added to many of the books.</p>

<p>These are the Official Text-books of the United Typothetae of America.</p>

<h3>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</h3>


<p class='dropcap'><span class="caps">This</span> series of Typographic Text-books is the result of the splendid
co-operation of a large number of firms and individuals engaged in the
printing business and its allied industries in the United States of
America.</p>

<p>The Committee on Education of the United Typothetae of America, under
whose auspices the books have been prepared and published, acknowledges
its indebtedness for the generous assistance rendered by the many
authors, printers, and others identified with this work.</p>

<p>While due acknowledgment is made on the title and copyright pages of
those contributing to each book, the Committee nevertheless felt that a
group list of co-operating firms would be of interest.</p>

<p>The following list is not complete, as it includes only those who have
co-operated in the production of a portion of the volumes, constituting
the first printing. As soon as the entire list of books comprising the
Typographic Technical Series has been completed (which the Committee
hopes will be at an early date), the full list will be printed in each
volume.</p>

<p>The Committee also desires to acknowledge its indebtedness to the many
subscribers to this Series who have patiently awaited its publication.</p>
